		<h1>Adding and positioning models</h1>
		<p><a name="models" id="models">All objects in a scene, whether they are characters, backgrounds or other, are loaded from model files and can be loaded and modified in the same ways.</a></p>
		<p>To add a model, select in the menu “File” the point “Add Model”. You can also click the “+”-button in the  <a href="help:anchor=documentwindow bookID=de.ferroequinologist.GLLara.help">document window</a>. You can select the model, no matter where on the hard drive it is. Select the .mesh or .mesh.ascii file.</p>
		<p>The new model appears in the default pose at origin of the scene. To move it away, there are several options:</p>
		<h2>In the document window</h2>
		<p><img src="localimages/move-item.png" alt="" /></p>
		<p>In the document window, you can move the model after you selected it in the list on the left. Enter the position directly or via the sliders. You can also rotate and scale the model.</p>
		<p>You can also rename the model in the list.</p>
		<h2>In the render window</h2>
		<p>In the <a href="help:anchor=renderwindow bookID=de.ferroequinologist.GLLara.help">render window</a> you can move the object with arrow keys or the mouse when it is selected:</p>

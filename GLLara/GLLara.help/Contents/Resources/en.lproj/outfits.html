		<p>For some models, outfits are available. This feature was first implemented by XPS and allows you to load an additional outfit model that is posed together with the original. The main purpose for this is clothes.</p>
		<p>In GLLara you can use any object as outfit of another one, to create own compositions. There is no guarantee that they will work well together, however. You can also load several outfits or apply outfits to an outfit.</p>
		<p>To do any of this, select the item in the <a href="help:anchor=documentwindow bookID=de.ferroequinologist.GLLara.help">document window</a> and click the “Load outfit” button. The outfit appears as another object in the list, after <a href="meshes.html">meshes</a> and  <a href="help:anchor=documentwindowbones bookID=de.ferroequinologist.GLLara.help">bones</a>. The bones of the outfit are added to the skeleton of the original object. Where both have bones with the same name, the bone of the original model is used.</p>

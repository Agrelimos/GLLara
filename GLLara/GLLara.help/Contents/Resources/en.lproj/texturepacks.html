		<p>For some models, there are texture packs available. These change the look of a model by exchanging textures.</p>
		<p>A texture pack is a folder containing image files. Other types of files are allowed (and necessary for some other apps, like XPS), but will be ignored.</p>
		<p>To load a texture pack, select the object in the <a href="help:anchor=documentwindow bookID=de.ferroequinologist.GLLara.help">document window</a> and click the “Load Texture pack” button. You can select any folder as a texture pack.</p>
		<p>Each texture of an object which has a counter part with the same file name will be replaced by this counterpart. All other textures without this counterpart remain as they were. To revert to the original, simply load the original model‘s folder as a texture pack.</p>
		<p>If you have several copies of a model in your scene, then only the textures of the selected one will be changed.</p>

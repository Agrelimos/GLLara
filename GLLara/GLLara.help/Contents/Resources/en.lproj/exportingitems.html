		<p>You can export models you changed to use them in other scenes or give them to others. The pose is not saved along with this.</p>
		<p class="notice">Note: Unless you created the original model yourself, you can only publish your altered version if the original author has given everyone or you specifically permission.</p>
		<p>To export the model, select it in the <a href="help:anchor=documentwindow bookID=de.ferroequinologist.GLLara.help">document window</a> and then, in the menu “File”, select “Export selected Model…”. Then choose a place to save it.</p>
		<p>GLLara creates a folder with the chosen name and copies all textures there. It saves the model under the names ”generic_item.mesh” und “generic_item.mesh.ascii” in there.</p>
		<p class="notice">Note: Not all objects can be saved in binary at this time. In this case, only the “generic_item.mesh.ascii” file will be created. Objects that were originally an OBJ file cannot be exported at all. You will receive an error if you do.</p>

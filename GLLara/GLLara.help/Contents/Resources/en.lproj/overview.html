		<h1>Overview over the user interface</h1>
		<p>A document in GLLara contains two types of windows: A single document window and arbitarily many render windows..</p>
		<h2><a name="documentwindow" id="documentwindow">The document window</a></h2>
		<p>In the document window, you can change scene settings, add or delete items, set poses or change the models.</p>
		<p><img src="localimages/documentwindow.png" alt="" /></p>
		<p>The list on the left contains the current selection. You can see the settings for <a href="lights.html">lights</a> and all placed <a href="placingmodels.html">models</a>. In the future, additional settings will be placed here, too. When opening a new window, the items list is empty. You can place characters, objects and scenes.</p>
		<p>In the pane on the right you can change the settings of the objects selected on the left.</p>
		<p>With the buttons on the bottom you can add models or remove existing ones.</p>
		
		<h2><a name="renderwindow" id="renderwindow">The render windows</a></h2>
		<p>You can open as many render windows as you like. They will all show the same scene from different angles. You can use this for example to open a window showing the entire scene, and use another to closely look at details youâ€˜re working on. The positions and camera angles of the windows are saved in the document and will be restored the next time you open it.</p>
		<p>To move the camera, you can use keyboard and mouse or trackpad: <a href="navigation.html">Navigating in 3D</a></p>
		<p><img src="../shared/renderwindow.png" alt="" /></p>
		<p>With the list on the bottom right you can select camera targets. These are defined by placed items and offer useful positions for the camera. You can rotate around them.</p>
		<p><a name="renderwindowsettings" id="renderwindowsettings">At the bottom right, you also find the render window settings.</a></p>
		<p><img src="localimages/renderwindowsettings.png" alt="" /></p>
		<p>Here, you can explicitly choose particular positions and angles. You can also lock the camera position and window sizes so you do not change them by accident.</p>

		<p>Shaders are small programs that determine how an object is displayed, based on textures and render parameters. You cannot define new ones, but you can select from several existing ones.</p>
		<p>To do this, select the <a href="meshes.html">mesh</a>. You can select any shader in the list. Not all shaders are available for all objects.</p>
		<p>If a shader uses <a href="textures.html">textures</a> that a mesh does not currently have, default textures are used. You can keep them or replace them with your own. If a shader does not all textures, the surplus ones are kept but not used.</p>
		<p>The same applies for <a href="renderparameters.html">render parameters</a>.</p>

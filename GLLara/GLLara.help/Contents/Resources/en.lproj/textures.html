		<p>You can change the textures of every object, for example to create different versions of clothes.</p>
		<p>To change a texture, select the <a href="meshes.html">Mesh</a> that has to be changed. Depending on the selected <a href="shaders.html">shader</a>, this mesh can have one or several textures. These textures have different tasks, which are explained shortly in the field.</p>
		<p>You select a new texture by dragging it from the Finder to the image field. GLLara supports all graphics formats that Preview and Quick Look can open. It also supports different types of DDS files.</p>
		<p>If a texture changes, for example because you recolored something in an image editor, GLLara automatically and immediately loads the new version.</p>

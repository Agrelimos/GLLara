		<p>You can export the current view of a <a href="help:anchor=renderwindow bookID=de.ferroequinologist.GLLara.help">render window</a> as an image. This gives you more options than a screenshot, since you can export the images in higher resolutions or with a transparent background.</p>
		<p>To export, ensure that the render window you want to export is in the front. Then in the menu “File” select the item “Render to Image…”.</p>
		<p>You can select arbitrary sizes (up to 50,000 pixels edge length) and a number of file formats. Note that larger files need longer for saving. Not all programs can open very large files without problems.</p>
		<p class="notice">Note: There are often better results if you render the image at a larger size than you need, and then scale it down in an image editing app.</p>
		<p>If the file format supports transparency (like e.g. Portable Network Graphics, in short <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>), then the background will appear transparent. This makes it easier to create image manipulations.</p>

		<p>You can export a pose to use it in other scenes or make it available to others. This stores the positions of the bones and their names, so that you can use them on other models, too. You can save all of a model‘s bones or just a selection.</p>
		<p class="notice">Notice: Poses created with GLLara can be used in XNALara and XPS, too.</p>
		<p>To export all bones, select the item in the <a href="help:anchor=documentwindow bookID=de.ferroequinologist.GLLara.help">document window</a>. If you want to export only some of them, select them in the document or <a href="help:anchor=renderwindow bookID=de.ferroequinologist.GLLara.help">render window</a>.</p>
		<p>In the menu “File” choose “Export selected pose”. You can choose whether bones named “unnamed” (with or without following number) are exported werden. Such bones are hidden in XNALara and XPS by default.</p>
